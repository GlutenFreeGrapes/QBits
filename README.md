## How to use
When the program is run, you will be prompted with a screen asking for inputs on what categories you want, difficulties, etc. Click the buttons labeled "Click to select options" and select your options. You can also select the time interval in milliseconds between each word and whether you want tossups, bonuses, or both. 

When you have selected your options, you should be able to reading questions. Your stats for the session will be displayed at the top of the window. When you buzz, there will be an 8-second timer for you to type in your answer. At the end of tossups, there is a 5-second window to let you buzz in, and at the end of bonuses, there is a 10-second timer to answer. 

If you ever want to change your categories or tossups, you can always head back to the home screen via the [Back] button, there you can adjust the difficulty, which categories you want, and more. 

When you want to leave the session, you can hit the [Leave] button or head back to the home screen and hit the [Quit] button. If you have answered any tossups or bonuses, the program will export a text file containing the questions you had(both the ones you answered and the ones you skipped), as well as your stats and how you did on each question.
